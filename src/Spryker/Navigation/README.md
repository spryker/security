Navigation module manages multiple navigation menus that can be displayed on the frontend (Yves). Every navigation section can contain its own nested structure of navigation nodes. Navigation nodes have types that help define what kind of link they represent. To control and adjust Navigation node appearance a custom CSS classes can be assigned to them. Navigation module provides database structure and a public API to manage whatâ€™s in the database. It also provides a small toolkit for rendering navigation menus in the frontend.
