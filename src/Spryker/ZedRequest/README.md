# ZedRequest Module

ZedRequest facilitates the connection between the frontend application (Yves) to the backend (Zed). The connection is a HTTP POST request with a transfer object as a payload. It provides a client that is used by almost all the other clients in order to send requests from the frontend application and get responses from the backend.

## Installation
