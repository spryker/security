# ProductOption Module

ProductOption extends products with additional layer of optional items that can be sold with the actual product. Options are normally the type of add-ons that do not have stock and they cannot be bought on their own. Some examples of product options are insurance or gift wrapping, as such, they can only exist if the actual main product is bought. Product options are linked to abstract products.
