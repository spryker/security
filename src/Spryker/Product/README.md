# Product Module

Product provides base infrastructure and CRUD operations to handle abstract product and concrete products. Typically, product data is maintained and enriched in an external Product Information Management (PIM) system. As soon as data is gathered, they are imported to Spryker OS. Incoming product data is transformed into the project specific data structure.

## Installation

```
composer require spryker/product
```
